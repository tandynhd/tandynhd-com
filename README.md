# 🎮 My Little Corner of the Internet

Hey there! Welcome to my personal website 👋

Most of what you’ll find here is the result of me _vibe coding_ when I’ve got some spare time — a mix of goofy experiments and actual professional work.

Here’s what’s inside:

- **🕹️ Fun Web Games** – I like messing around with browser games just for the fun of it. You’ll find a growing collection of silly, experimental, and sometimes downright weird games on the **Home Page**.
- **💼 Portfolio** – When I’m not busy making nonsense games, I’m working on real projects. The **Portfolio Page** is where I list the actual work I’ve done.

Basically, this site is part playground, part portfolio, and fully me.

## 🚀 What’s on the site?

### 🏠 Home Page

A bunch of browser games I’ve built for fun. Nothing serious — just things that made me laugh (or rage) while coding.

### 📂 Portfolio Page

A proper, polished list of my work projects. This is where I try to look like a grown-up with actual skills.

## 🙌 Why does this site exist?

Because the internet needs more weird, personal corners — and I needed a spot to dump everything I make.  
So pull up a chair, click around, and enjoy!
